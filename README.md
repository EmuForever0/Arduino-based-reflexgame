This is my arduino LED pattern game feturing both sound and LEDs
This game uses variables and basic functions to make it work
Tools needed:
9 LED (personally i choose 8 of them being orange and the other one being white)
1 piezo electric speaker
A push button with 4 pads
10 500 ohm resistors (0.5k)
1 10K ohm resistor
and of course an arduino, personally i used an Arduino UNO R3

How it works:

The game boots and then you try to push the button while the white LED is on
if you succed a victory chime will play
if you fail a lose chime will playm
